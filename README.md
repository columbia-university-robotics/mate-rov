2. [Submit a pull request](https://github.com/columbia-university-robotics/mate-rov/pulls) to commit the changes to the repository. You'll require **one approval** from another developer before the code can be merged to the `master` branch.
3. Once approved, your remote branch will be committed to `master`.
